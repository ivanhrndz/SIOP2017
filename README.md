# Automated Data Collection with Python (SIOP 2017 Master Tutorial)

## Overview

All materials accompanying the SIOP 2017 master tutorial, "Automated Data Collection with Python", can be found on this repository.

All code-related files are in the "notebooks" directory.

All presentation- and handout-related files are in the "pdfs" directory.

When reading through the materials for the first time, the following order is recommended:
+ [Slides](https://github.com/ivanhrndz/SIOP2017/blob/master/pdfs/Automated%20Data%20CollectionSlides.pdf)
+ [Code Walkthrough](https://github.com/ivanhrndz/SIOP2017/blob/master/notebooks/Automated%20Data%20Collection.ipynb)
+ [Exercises](https://github.com/ivanhrndz/SIOP2017/blob/master/pdfs/AutomatedCollectingExercises.pdf)
+ [Exercise Solutions](https://github.com/ivanhrndz/SIOP2017/blob/master/notebooks/AutomatedDataCollectionExercises.ipynb)

Running the code requires that Python 2.7 is installed on your computer along with the urllib and bs4 (BeauitfulSoup) libraries.

Anaconda, a cross-platform distribution of Python with all the the necessary library can be downloaded from: [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

When Anaconda is installed, code can be run either though an iPython shell, Spyder, or from the Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb).
